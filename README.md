# abap2famix

This project offers the mechanism for producing MSE files that can be loaded in moosetechnology.org out of ABAP-OO code.

ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming, originally Allgemeiner Berichts-Aufbereitungs-Prozessor) is the programming language (alongside Java)
for the SAP platform.

MSE is a textual format to serialize source code models in the Moose software analysis platform.

Therefore this project allows to take an ABAP source code, serialize it in MSE, then load it in Moose to analyse the source code.
